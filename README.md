# Why awless

`awless` stands out by providing the following features:

- small and hierarchical set of commands
- create and revert fully-fledged infrastructures through a new simple and powerful templating language (see [`awless` templates (wiki)](https://github.com/talkimhi/awless/wiki/Templates))
- local log of all your cloud modifications done through `awless`
- exploration of your cloud infrastructure and resources relations, **even offline** using a local graph storage
- greater output's readability with numerous machine and human friendly formats
- ensure smart defaults & security best practices
- connect easily using awless' smart SSH to your private & public instances

</p>

- Explore a resource given only a *name* (or id/arn) showing its properties, relations, dependencies, etc.: `awless show`
- Aliasing of resources through their natural name so you don't have to always use cryptic ids that are impossible to remember
- Creation, update and deletion of complex infrastructures with smart defaults and sound autocomplete through awless templates: `awless run my-awless-templates/create_my_infra.txt`
- Powerful CRUD CLI one-liner (integrated in the awless templating engine) with: `awless create instance ...`, `awless create vpc ...`, `awless attach policy ...`
- Easy reporting of all the CLI template executions: `awless log`
- Revert of executed templates and resources creation: `awless revert`
- Create instances with a specific community bare distribution independently of the AWS region: `awless create instance distro=debian ...`
- Leveraging AWS `userdata` to provision instance on creation given remote (i.e http) or local scripts: `awless create instance ... userdata=http://...` 
- Clean and simple SSH to public & private instances using only a name: `awless ssh my-production-instance`, `awless ssh redis-prod --through jump-server`
- Resolve public images dynamically (i.e. independant of the region specific AMI id): `awless search images canonical:ubuntu:xenial --latest-id`
- Switch AWS accounts (i.e. profile) and regions easily with `awless switch`
- Inspectors are small CLI utilities to run analysis on your cloud resources graphs: `awless inspect`
- Manual sync mode to fetch & store resources locally. Then query & inspect your cloud offline: `awless sync`
- CLI autocompletion for Unix/Linux's bash and zsh `awless completion`
- Clear and easy listing of multi-region cloud resources (subnets, instances, users, buckets, records, etc.) on AWS EC2, IAM, S3, RDS, AutoScaling, SNS, SQS, Route53, CloudWatch, CloudFormation, Lambda, etc.: `awless list`
- Output formats either human (Markdown-compatible tables) or machine readable (csv, tsv, json, ...): `--format`
- Listing filters via *resources properties* or *resources tags*: `--filter property=val`, `--tag Env=Production`, `--tag-value Purchased`, `--tag-key Dept,Internal`
